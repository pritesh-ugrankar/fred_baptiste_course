    "Yes, you can access the same Git repository from another laptop, but you'll need to set up SSH authentication on the new laptop as well. Just having access on one machine doesn't automatically grant it on another.\n",

    "## How to Access the Repo from Another Laptop ðŸ’»\n",
    "\n",
    "To access the same Git repository using SSH from your new laptop, you'll need to replicate the SSH key setup you successfully completed on your first laptop for this specific repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the process:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1\\. Generate a New SSH Key on the New Laptop\n",
    "\n",
    "It's **highly recommended** to generate a **new, unique SSH key pair** for your new laptop. Do **not** copy your private key from the first laptop to the second, as this is a security risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Open your terminal** on the *new* laptop.\n",
    "2.  **Generate a new SSH key pair**, specifying a custom location if you prefer, similar to what you did before. For example:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C \"your_email@example.com - new_laptop_github\" -f /Users/yourusername/Documents/git_keys/id_github_new_laptop\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "      * Replace `your_email@example.com` with your actual email.\n",
    "      * Choose a descriptive filename and path (e.g., `/Users/yourusername/Documents/git_keys/id_github_new_laptop`).\n",
    "      * **Set a strong passphrase** when prompted.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2\\. Configure SSH on the New Laptop\n",
    "\n",
    "Create or modify your `~/.ssh/config` file on the *new* laptop to tell Git where to find this new key for GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Create/Open `~/.ssh/config`** (if it doesn't exist):\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    touch ~/.ssh/config\n",
    "    chmod 600 ~/.ssh/config\n",
    "    nano ~/.ssh/config # or your preferred editor\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "2.  **Add the GitHub entry**:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Host github.com\n",
    "      HostName github.com\n",
    "      User git\n",
    "      IdentityFile /Users/yourusername/Documents/git_keys/id_github_new_laptop # <--- Use the path to your NEW key\n",
    "      IdentitiesOnly yes\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Make sure the `IdentityFile` path points exactly to the private key file you just generated on this new laptop.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3\\. Add the New Public Key to Your GitHub Account\n",
    "\n",
    "Your GitHub account needs to recognize the *new* public key from your second laptop.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Copy the content of the new public key**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    cat /Users/yourusername/Documents/git_keys/id_github_new_laptop.pub\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Copy the entire output**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Go to GitHub.com**:\n",
    "\n",
    "      * Log in to your GitHub account.\n",
    "      * Navigate to **Settings** (click your profile photo) -\\> **SSH and GPG keys**.\n",
    "      * Click **New SSH key** or **Add SSH key**.\n",
    "      * Give it a descriptive **Title** (e.g., \"My New Laptop Git Key\").\n",
    "      * **Paste the copied public key** into the \"Key\" field.\n",
    "      * Click **Add SSH key**. You may need to confirm your GitHub password.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4\\. Load the Key into the SSH Agent on the New Laptop\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Start the SSH agent**:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    eval \"$(ssh-agent -s)\"\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "2.  **Add your new private key to the agent**:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    ssh-add /Users/yourusername/Documents/git_keys/id_github_new_laptop\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Enter your passphrase if prompted.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5\\. Clone or Access the Repository on the New Laptop\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can interact with your repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **If you haven't cloned it yet**:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    git clone git@github.com:pritesh-ugrankar/fred_baptiste_course.git\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "  * **If you already have a copy but need to ensure it's using SSH**:\n",
    "    Navigate to the repository directory and verify/set the remote URL:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    cd path/to/fred_baptiste_course\n",
    "    git remote -v\n",
    "    # If it's HTTPS, change it:\n",
    "    git remote set-url origin git@github.com:pritesh-ugrankar/fred_baptiste_course.git\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, you can perform `git pull` or `git push` commands as usual."
