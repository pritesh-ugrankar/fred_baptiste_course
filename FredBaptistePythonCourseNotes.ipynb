    "###Understanding *Metaclass* and ```type```\n",
    "In Python, everything is an object, and that includes classes themselves. Just as an instance (like 5 or \"hello\") is an object created from a class (like int or str), a class itself is an object created from a metaclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "The _default metaclass_ in Python, and the one that creates all standard classes, is ```type```.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break it down:\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects are instances of classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> num = 10\n",
    ">>> type(num)\n",
    "<class 'int'>\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, ```num``` is an object, and it's an ```instance``` of the ```int``` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes themselves are ```instances``` of ```metaclasses```:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> class MyClass:\n",
    "...     pass\n",
    ">>> type(MyClass)\n",
    "<class 'type'>\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, ```MyClass``` is a _class_, and it's an _instance_ of the ```type``` _metaclass_.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that ```type``` is essentially the *\"class of classes.\"* When you define a class using the class keyword, Python implicitly uses type to construct that class object.\n",
    "\n",
    "### But what really is an _object??_\n",
    "\n",
    "An object has a _state_ and _functionality_.\n",

    "### Why Metaclasses Matter\n",
    "Metaclasses allow you to define how classes are created. They provide a powerful mechanism for advanced introspection and class customization, enabling you to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Modify class creation:** Automatically add methods or attributes to newly created classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Enforce design patterns:** Ensure all classes in a certain hierarchy conform to specific rules.\n",
